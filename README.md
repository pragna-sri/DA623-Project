## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This repository presents a concise study and presentation of **VisualBERT**, a pioneering model that integrates vision and language by feeding both image region features and text tokens into a single BERT-style Transformer. VisualBERT demonstrates that a simple early-fusion architecture, trained with masked language modeling and imageâ€“text matching, can rival more complex dual-stream models on a variety of multimodal tasks.
